# step1 
- To write a `Person` class, it must have `id`, `name` and `age` attributes, and an `introduce` method.
   The `introduce` method returns a string like:

   >My name is Tom. I am 18 years old.

- To distinguish people with the same name and age, `Person` class needs to add an `id` attribute.
   We judge whether it is the same person by `id` attribute.
